## Introduction

This is a personal project on solving an analysis question on
convergent series. The question is:
Suppose aₙ ≥ 0 ∀ n and converges to a ∈ [0,1). 
Prove ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%20%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20a_n%5En%20&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)
Prove $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n^n$$ converges
Prove ∑_{n=1}^∞ aₙ^n converges.
You can alsof find out what the question is
by heading to the last lemma and read the comment block above it.
