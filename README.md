## Introduction

This is a personal project on solving an analysis question on
convergent series. The question is:
Suppose aₙ ≥ 0 ∀ n and converges to a ∈ [0,1). 
Prove that ![equation](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%20%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty%20a_n%5En%20&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=fourier&edit=0)
You can also find out what the question is in the code
by heading to the last lemma of `src/UROP.lean` and read the comment block above it.
