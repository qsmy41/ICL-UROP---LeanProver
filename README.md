## Introduction

This is a personal project on solving an analysis question on
convergent series. The question is:
Suppose aₙ ≥ 0 ∀ n and converges to a ∈ [0,1). 
Prove $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n^n$$ converges
Prove ∑_{n=1}^∞ aₙ^n converges.
You can alsof find out what the question is
by heading to the last lemma and read the comment block above it.
